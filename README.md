# RottenFood

This is a [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/)-plugin that gives items the abillity to age. You can config any item to change as time goes on.

## What is RottenFood doing exactly
With **RottenFood** you can define items to get older the longer they exist.
E.g. steaks that you store in a chest can become `rotten_flesh` after a week if you don't eat them.
Or all potatoes could suddenly be poisonous if you logged of for a month.
Or flowers that you just put in some chest instead of planting them can dry out after 3 days without water and sunlight..

## Building
Simply run the `gradle` command.

## Installing
Put the compiled .jar in the mods-folder of a Sponge-Server

## Contributing
If you want to contribute, just make a pull request.
Explain what and why you changed it, and make sure everything is well documented and formatted.
There is no styleguide, just try to match the rest of the code somehow.
